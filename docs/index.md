# Welcome!

I'm Emma, a technical writer, creative writer, and editor. I've been writing technical documentation for a variety of industries since 2012, focusing on product documentation. Because I enjoy learning, adding new skills to my repetoire, and gaining new experiences, I am now delving into the world of developer and API documentation.

## Portfolio

On this site you will find samples of my work from throughout my career, including the link to a website I created in 2017 and still maintain, as well as my resume.

I can work with multiple programming languages including HTML, Java, and JavaScript, and, more recently, Python.

## About Me

I have a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science: Information Systems, minors in Business Administration, Professional Writing, and Creative Writing from Mansfield University.

Besides writing technical documentation, I also enjoy designing and building databases and websites.

I have a passion for learning about history, languages, and cultures. While my native language is English, I can also speak conversational Spanish, use basic American Sign Language, and know at least a couple of words in a dozen other languages.

I worked as a journalist for a local newspaper and MU's student newspaper, becoming the Editor-in-Chief of the student newspaper my senior year.

## Sample 1
**Background:** For an assessment during a job interview process, I was asked to complete a set of formatting, editing, and writing tasks. The writing task had three prompts to choose from and I was required to pick two of them. One prompt involved explaining how to download and set Google Chrome as the default browser for an elderly relative, Great Aunt Gertrude, who only uses Microsoft Edge.

I chose a conversational tone given the target audience, but scaled the screenshots to typical instruction sizes, although larger screenshots might be preferable for elderly users. If I were writing these instructions for a wider audience, I would have to consider the challenge of potential variations in users' computer setups, as it could impact the clarity of instructions.

**Chrome Installation Instructions:**

1.	Open a new Microsoft Edge window.

1.	In the search bar at the top, type **Google Chrome**, then press **Enter** on your keyboard.

                                 *Above: Apps Menu*
